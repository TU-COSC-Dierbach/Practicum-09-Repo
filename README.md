## PRACTICUM 9 - If Statements in Java.<br>

### BACKGROUND
Many people think that leap years are years that are divisble by 4. Actually, there need to be period adjustments made every 100 and every 400 years. The rules for when a year is a leap years is are follows:
<br><br>
`A year is a leap_year if is divisible by 4, except:`<br>
`  - is also divisible by 100, then it is NOT a leap year.`<br>
`  - is also divisible by 400, then it IS a leap year.`
<br><br>
There are stories of calendars for the year 2000 being incorrect
because of not knowning about the "divisible by 400" part of the rule.
<br><br>
### WHAT TO DO

- `Make any needed changes` to the program so that the program can execute without any syntax, runtime or logic errors.
